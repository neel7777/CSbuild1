My version of Conway's Game of Life, built using hooks
Can start with a random configuration or build out your own configuration.
Able to change speed of iterations - 600ms, 300ms, 50ms. 
Lower than 100 cells - yellow, indication lower population, 100-300 - blue, medium population,
over 300 - red, high population.
